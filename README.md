# PTC-Mathcad-to-LaTeX-parser
A Python 3.x application to read PTC Mathcad 15 files and output them as LaTeX files.  
Doesn't fully work with everything yet. I've mainly added support for the math I use myself.  
Only tested on Mathcad 15 *.xmcd* files, the structure is probably different for other versions?

## Quick (and dirty) guide
1. Install Anaconda for Python 3.x at https://www.continuum.io/downloads
2. Reboot?
3. Git clone this repository (Download all files)
4. Doubleclick main.py (or run the file from shell)
5. Click some buttons in the GUI
6. Pray that all your desired math is supported

View the generated LaTeX file with a editor, or generate a pdf.
I can recommend http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/, which works on Windows, MacOsX and Linux.  
To be documented...
